If it is, it'll return that node. If no cycle, it'll just keep iterating until there is no next node. Although effective in getting a solution, it does require potentially a lot of space depending on the list size (which we don't know).\n",

We could bring the hash table idea back, though that still creates a space issue and worst case is that the whole list is a cycle. So instead, we bring back two pointers that'll, this time, be a set distance apart. The distance will by the cycle length since that means that as we iterate through the list, the first point will loop around the cycle then meet the second pointer at the head of the cycle at the end (since they're the whole cycle apart from each other).\n",
